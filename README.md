# Secret Santa

A quick-n-dirty secret Santa assignment tool that is meant to be run on the 
command-line.

To use:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/verbalhanglider/my_secret_santa_picker.git
$ cd my_secret_santa_picker
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python bin/run_assignments Janet,Bill,Erica
```

And, you will see who buys for Janet, who buys for Bill and who buys for Erica.
